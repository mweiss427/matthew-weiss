[Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155404219-matthew-weiss "Link to my profile") is the best thing I can find when it comes to organizing your books.  Books are sources of knowledge that are the keys to anything in life. If I read a 800 page book and have one, and only one, take away from the book its worth it.  One take away can change your life.  Life is a path, journey, and adventure, often the books we read on the adventure tell the story of who we are, what we believe and why we believe it.  Here are some take aways from the books I have read.

## Just Keep Buying: Proven Ways to Save Money and Build Your Wealth By [Nick Maggiulli](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21826464.Nick_Maggiulli),


The key take away I had with this book is that the decision to 'buy' should be a monthly budget conversation. Don't try to predict the markets, set it and forget it.  Just. Keep. Buying. Start with small increments and work up. When I say small, I mean small.  $1 a day is a good start.  While not directly expressed in the book, even investing $1 a day is great. It goes back to the old time saying, "Pay yourself first."  While you should think about what to invest in.  That is not a problem I am personally focused on.  This book gives you solid basic information, and equations that is helpful.   Income - Spending = Savings.
