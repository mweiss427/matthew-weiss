# Mastering the Art of CPU Scheduling in Ubuntu: A Lighthearted Guide for Computer Science Students

## Introduction

Ah, CPU scheduling! A subtle dance of processes vying for the CPU's attention as they glide through the intricate ballet of the operating system. As a computer science student and budding developer, understanding CPU scheduling in Ubuntu is not just a skill â€“ it's an art form. In this blog post, we will delve into the fascinating world of CPU scheduling in Ubuntu and most Linux systems, exploring the algorithms and priority systems that govern this delightful dance.

## Why Should You Read This?

Curious minds might wonder, "Why should I, an ambitious developer, invest my time in understanding CPU scheduling?" Fear not, for we have two excellent reasons for you to embark on this enlightening journey:

1. **Performance optimization**: Like a master painter who understands the nuance of every brushstroke, a developer who grasps CPU scheduling can create software that makes the most efficient use of system resources, resulting in a masterpiece of performance and responsiveness.

2. **Debugging and troubleshooting**: Just as a detective carefully examines every clue, a developer with a clear understanding of scheduling algorithms and process management can identify performance bottlenecks and resolve issues related to process contention, making debugging and maintenance as thrilling as a whodunit novel.

## CPU Scheduling: The Basics

CPU scheduling is the art of orchestrating processes, each clamoring for the CPU's affection like a group of suitors vying for the heart of a fair maiden. In Linux systems, CPU time is divided into time slices, with each process receiving a slice to serenade the CPU with its symphony of instructions.

There are five states in the process life cycle, reminiscent of a Shakespearean play: start, ready, wait, run, and end.

## Ubuntu's CPU Scheduling Algorithms

Ubuntu, like a wise and just ruler, employs two primary scheduling systems:

1. **Time-sharing system for fair scheduling**
2. **Real-time algorithm for processes requiring specific time constraints**

### Time-Sharing System

The time-sharing system is like a royal court ball, where each process takes its turn in a round-robin dance based on the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) approach. Processes are assigned different priority levels, with real-time tasks enjoying the spotlight as the belle of the ball.

Managing the elaborate dance of processes, the scheduler maintains two separate queues: the run queue and the expired queue. When the run queue has danced the night away, the expired queue takes center stage.

To prevent process starvation, a phenomenon akin to a wallflower waiting for a dance, all processes have their priority levels gracefully reduced by a timer interrupt. This way, even the shyest of processes can take their turn in the limelight.

### Real-Time Algorithm

The real-time algorithm is like a carefully choreographed ballet, ensuring that critical processes perform their dance with precision and grace.

## Conclusion

The art of CPU scheduling in Ubuntu and other Linux systems is a wondrous journey that every computer science student and developer should experience. By learning about the time-sharing and real-time algorithms, as well as the priority systems governing this exquisite dance, you will not only become a more skilled developer but also a true connoisseur of the enchanting world of operating systems.
