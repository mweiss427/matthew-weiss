            <h1>GM</h1>
                <p>This website is the center of my internet presence. I am Matthew Weiss, a Wisconsinite that believes in a very bright future.  As of 12/30/2022 my internet presence is 0. Or my valuable internet presence was 0, I was a lurker. I have some social media platforms that I maintain for a bit of visibility.</p>
    
    <p>My website is an application - it is here to help me automate my life - I&rsquo;m a writer it&#39;s a part of who I am. I want to interact with a large number of people in my life. I believe there is a finite number of people in the world you can know and have a relationship with. Everyone in my life is special. I know that number is limited to around 150 people. With the top 5 relationships in my life being the most important. So in order to reach more people. I need to capture content and deliver it. So of course instead of shearing it on socal media, I hide it on my website.</p>
    
    <p>I am rejecting the norm. I am leading by example, Social media is the fast food of information. High-quality informations comes from websites - While that isn&rsquo;t necessarily true today. High quality information comes from people and since this is my website, everyone who knows me knows that what is on my website is content I deem important or high quality.</p>
    
    <p>Features of my website -</p>
    
    <p>Feature 1, you&rsquo;re reading it - every software developer should have their own blog. This is my blog. The is my MVP, once I get a blog I will have a place to post. Thanks to internet archives my content is stored. Its not your typical blog. I am a DevOps Engineer, so I have my content pipline highly operationalized and automated at this point.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Logistically I follow the <a href="https://www.notion.so/C-O-D-E-Implementation-e9ed635746ce4426a5586e3b02d2cd8f">C.O.D.E. Implementation</a> Which is how I store my knowledge.</li>
        <li>Functionally the task list is quite different. I still have an enormous amount of manual steps that I&rsquo;m trying to strip away. One step at a time, at the time of writing I haven&rsquo;t even launched my website.</li>
        <li>Ideally, I&rsquo;ll have my app of choice for writing words, currently it is notion, and my app of writing code to be the same - I should start looking at how writers should write in VS code.
        <ul>
            <li>if there is not any tools I am going to make them.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Feature - Publishing My Writing</p>
    
    <p>Again, I&rsquo;m a devops engineer of course I&rsquo;m going to be automating that. I want my home page to start be what I&rsquo;m currently writing or my latest peice. that is the thing I&rsquo;m most interested in and therefore is at the front of my mind. Since I treat my website like the front door to my online house - but its a website. and its a feature, so there will likely be options to where I put the content and for how long its up. Long term I will have trackers and analytics down on my traffic, real time tune of my home page where it automatticly changes the content based on website traffic and and all that jazz - one step at a time dreamer guy.</p>
    
    <p>Feature - Home Screen</p>
    
    <p>The home screen is going to have a lot of links - links to get you off of my home screen. I pay for my online presents currently I don&rsquo;t have a budget for one. So a lot of my content will be fanned out across the interent. I&rsquo;m trying to keep that cost down. A goal of mine is to guarantee that my site will never go down. Going down implies that there is a small group of people that can control my content. The goal is to make sure my website is decentralized.</p>
    
    <p>Feature - Blog bars</p>
    
    <p>these are my words organized on the home screen.</p>
    
    <p>Feature</p>
    
    <p>Application viewers. Since I&rsquo;m going to build more then a websites. There is a portal for viewing my applications.</p>
    
    <p>Feature Viewers - I&rsquo;m also a programmer and a big audance of programmers are programmers. So I want a list of pluggable features to be easy to find. There will be a list. I&rsquo;ll mostly be building this feature for myself. I don&rsquo;t want to be contstantly googling how to put and image in a pdf and resize it. Or how to lint and debug react. I want my tools stored, an orginized tool shop makes you highly effective - as an auto macanic.</p>
    
    <p>public calendar, contacts</p>
    
    <p>I want to talk to people, I want them to communicate with me through a specific lines of communication. If someone wants to talk to me - Here is how. email me.</p>
    
    <p>Feature Plants</p>
    
    <p>I have plants in the house - I&rsquo;m not a botanist, but I want thier help. Here are updated pictures of my plants. and the ability for people to comment on them and</p>
    
    <h3>Amazon</h3>
    
    <p>If Amazon wanted to shut down most of the interent, they could. my website will be up. Note - I work in AWS almost daily I do think it is a fantastic product, just not for me. Currently my site is not perfect. That goal is there but on pause. I can&rsquo;t worry about being a dooms day prepper before having content to prep. I don&rsquo;t want to by the locks before the house.</p>
